            <h6>Steps to build and simulate an electricity distribution network</h6>
            <ol>
                <li style="padding: 0.2rem 0rem">
                    <b>Build the network.</b> 
                    <br>Leave the default options in the “Electricity distribution network parameters” section or modify them to change the network.
                    <br>The integrated MV-LV 11kV urban network represents a town of around 20k households. 
                    <br>You can choose up to 5 LV networks - this is equivalent to simulating 5 neighbourhoods in detail (2 examples of LV networks/neighbourhoods, from the LVNS project, are shown on top of the top figure below.
                </li>
                <li style="padding: 0.2rem 0rem">
                    <b>Assign data to the network.</b>
                    <br>Use available demand and generation profiles or upload your own data in “Demand and generation profiles” section.
                    <br>You can choose to have ditributed generation (e.g.commercial solar installations) and fast charging stations.
                    <br>Zoom in on the second picture to see their location on the network.
                    <br>Then you can choose the mix and penetration levels of green technologies assigned to the households, which are shown as dots on the 2 LV networks examples below.
                </li>
                <li style="padding: 0.2rem 0rem">
                    <b>Run your simulation.</b>
                    <br>Click submit and wait for up to a minute for the results.
                    <br>You can save the figures and download some of output data as csv.
                    <br>The results include the status of the electricity network, specifically voltage and thermal constraints for the MV and LV networks.
