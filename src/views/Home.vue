    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Electric vehicles (EVs) can break our dependence on fossil fuels in
      transport and energy sectors. However, mass adoption of EVs introduces
      significant and disruptive electricity demand to meet the charging needs
      of these vehicles. Vehicle grid integration strategies, underpinned by
      data science, ensure that electric vehicle charging infrastructure is
      synergistic with the electricity grid, reliable, cost effective and
      sustainable.
